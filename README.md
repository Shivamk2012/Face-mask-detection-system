#Face mask detection system:
Since the infectious coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was first reported in Wuhan, it has become a public health problem in China and even around the world. This pandemic is having devastating effects on societies and economies around the world. The increase in the number of COVID-19 tests gives more information about the epidemic spread, which may lead to the possibility of surrounding it to prevent further infections. However, wearing a face mask that prevents the transmission of droplets in the air and maintaining an appropriate physical distance between people, and reducing close contact with each other can still be beneficial in combating this pandemic. Therefore, this project focuses on implementing a Face Mask Detection 
model which acts as an embedded vision system. The pretrained models such as the MobileNetV2, Tensorflow, Keras are used in our context. People violating social distancing or not wearing masks were detected. After implementing and deploying the models, the selected one achieved a confidence score of 100%. This model also provides a comparative study of different face detection and face mask classification models.This can be used with the existing embedded camera infrastructure to enable these analytics which can be applied to various verticals, as well as in an office building or at airport terminals/gates.

Objective of this Application:

Now-a-days Face Mask Detection has a great importance for our world. In pandemic mask is essential stuff for safety. It will basically help not to spread diseases. So, my mainobjective is to create a Face Mask detection model which will help us to detect a person wears a mask or not.

Python is a powerful open source programming language, which means that itâ€™s free to use while having all the properties that a programming language should have.

Python has some 72,000 libraries in the Python Package Index that aid in scientific calculations and machine learning applications. In this project we will be using Python as a programming language.


Tech stacks:
Python3
CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) in ML

We will be also having data sets to train our model , since the size of dataset is very large. I have put that in git ignore. we can later download datasets from kaggle or others datasourse API.
